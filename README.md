###Description: 
    This is a purely front-end React app. This is not for a real restaurant or business, just a playground for me to work on front-end design!

###Why: 
    I wanted to work on design skills, and this is loosely based off of a local restaurant here in Austin called Poke Austin ('https://www.poke-austin.com/'). Why not combine my two favorite foods?  

###Goals: 
    I would like to make this even more visually exciting as well as increase the quality content. The more I continue to build, the better the portfolio will get! 

###Deployment: 
    Site will be deployed when there is a MVP. (Est. end of February)

###Issues/Bugs:
    Although I have some media-queries already in here, it does need some touch up on several of the components to make it more mobile friendly.
