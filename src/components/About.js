        <p>You and I know Mochi Ice Cream as a rice ball with delicious premium ice cream on the 
          inside, but the word mochi actually has a larger meaning in Japan. In Mochi Ice Cream, 
          the word “mochi” mostly refers to the ball of sweet rice dough 
          that encapsulates that delicious ice cream. It’s known for being a symbol of good 
          fortune and happy marriages.</p>
